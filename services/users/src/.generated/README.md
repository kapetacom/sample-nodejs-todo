# Kapeta Readme
This file contains some structural information about this service.

This file will be overwritten every time you change the service definition in Kapeta.

## Folder Structure
This service is structured as follows:

### Generated files
All files in the following folders are generated by Kapeta - and should not be edited manually.
* ```src/.generated/config```: Contains your configuration entities
* ```src/.generated/data```: Contains anything related to databases
* ```src/.generated/entities```: Contains the public entities used by the service.
* ```src/.generated/rest```: Contains REST API routes.

### Editable files
All other files are editable - and will not be overwritten by Kapeta unless explictly mentioned in the file.

* ```src/service```: Contains the service layer logic. This is where you should add your business logic

### Path alias for generated files

To import generated files you can use the following path alias:
```typescript
import { MyEntity } from 'generated:entities/MyEntity';
```

## REST API 
To edit the REST API handlers edit the services found here:
* [src/service/UsersRouteService.tsx](src/service/UsersRouteService.tsx)

These are generated as TSX files to make it simple to render emails using JSX syntax.

The service files will only be generated if they don't already exist - or if they have not
changed since the last time they were generated.

### Errors
To throw an error with a specific HTTP status code from a REST API handler - use the following code:
```ts
import { RESTError } from '@kapeta/sdk-rest-route';
throw new RESTError('User not found', 404);
```
or simply:
```ts
someHandler(req:Request, res:Response) {
    res.sendError('User not found', 404);
}
```

Any exceptions thrown that are not RESTError will be converted to a 500 error.

All errors will be formatted as JSON - with the following structure:
```json
{
    "error": "My error message"
}
```

## Postgres: users
To use the "users" Postgres database - simply add the following code to your service:

```typescript
import { UsersDB } from 'generated:data/UsersDB';

class MyService {
    private db: UsersDB;
    
    constructor() {
        /**
         * Note: The database is not ready initially. It will be loaded during startup.
         * It is guaranteed to be ready before the first request is handled.
         * This means that the this.db.client property will not be ready during startup.
         */
        this.db = new UsersDB();
    }

    /**
     * The database client. 
     * A simple helper to make it a little shorter to access the database.
     */
    private get client() {
        return this.db.client;
    }

    /**
     * Example of how to use the database client.
     */
    async getUsers() {
        return await this.client.users.findMany({});
    }
}
```
### Schema changes
This service uses Prisma to manage the database schema.

A prisma schema looks something like this: 
```prisma
model Users {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  name      String?  @db.VarChar(255)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  @@map("users")
}
```

To edit the **users** database schema edit the Prisma schema files here:
- [db/users/schema.prisma](db/users/schema.prisma)

Read more about Prisma here:
https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

When you are done editing the schema, 
run the following command to generate a new database migration file:
```bash
npm run migrate:dev
```

Run the following command to apply the migration to your database:
```bash
npm run migrate
```


## Emails

To send simple emails - use the following code:
```tsx
import { EmailClient } from '@kapeta/sdk-smtp-client';
const emailClient = new EmailClient();
await emailClient.send({
    from: 'support@kapeta.com',
    to: 'someone@somewhere.com',
    subject: 'Hi!',
    text: 'Hello World!',
    html: '<h1>Hello World!</h1>',
});
```
E-mails are send using nodemailer. Read more here:
https://nodemailer.com/about/

To send emails rendered using React - use the following code: 
```tsx
import { EmailClient } from '@kapeta/sdk-smtp-client';
const emailClient = new EmailClient();
await emailClient.sendReact({
    from: 'support@kapeta.com',
    to: 'someone@somewhere.com',
    subject: 'Hi!',
    body: <MyEmail />,
});
```
This uses react-email - read more here: https://react.email/

### Email templates
Email templates are simply React components which are rendered using [react-email](https://react.email/).

### Testing
When sending e-mails locally it will use gosmtpd - which doesn't actually send any e-mails. 
It has a web interface and API where you can see the e-mails that would have been sent.
